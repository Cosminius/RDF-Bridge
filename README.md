RDF-Bridge converts RDF graphs stored in RDF4J into JSON and exposes them through a flexible GraphQL API. 
The pipeline exports RDF data to a JSON Server, serves queries via a GraphQL layer, and is powered by a Flask backend with a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend. 
The project simplifies mapping and synchronization between triplestores and modern web APIs, making semantic/linked data easy to integrate into web applications.
